# Tank-game
## Description
Me making a tank game inspired by wii tanks with Rust

The aims of this project are as follows:
- To hopefully gain a proficient knowledge of the 
syntax and concepts of Rust
- To develop an application that can be played online
via some-kind of multiplayer with other players
- To develop sophisticated NPC's (Non-Playable Character)
with artificial decision-making and machine learning implementations
to range the NPC's intelligence from mediocre to somewhat intelligent
- To develop a somewhat realistic/sophisticated physics system in the game 
##Workflow
